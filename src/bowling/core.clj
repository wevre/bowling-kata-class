;; Your task:
;;    Write function `score` that takes sequence of integer rolls and returns 
;;    correct bowling score.

(defn score
  "Takes sequence `rolls` of integers and returns correct bowling score."
  [rolls]
  0 ; replace this placeholder to return correct score
  )

;; Tests are found in namespace bowling.core-test. You can use built-in Calva
;; commands to run tests at any time to check your function.
;;    1. Jack in 
;;       a. key combo is C-M-c C-M-j
;;       b. command is "Calva: Start a Project REPL and Connect (aka Jack-In)"
;;    2. Evaluate this file to "prime" the REPL
;;       a. key combo is C-M-c ENTER
;;       b. command is "Calva: Load Current File and Dependencies"
;;    3. Run tests
;;       a. key combo is C-M-c, T
;;       b. command is "Calva: Run All Tests"
;;    4. Repeat step 3 as you work on your function.
;; 
;; HINT: You can bring up commands, and search them, with CTRL+SHIFT+P on
;; Windows or CMD+SHIFT+P on Mac, or choose View->Command Palette from the menu.
;; 
;; Before you make any changes to the function above, you can run the tests,
;; just to see what happens. The function ignores its input and returns 0, which
;; is not "correct" per se, but it will at least pass one of the tests.
